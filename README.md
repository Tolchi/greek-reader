Python 3 tool for generating (initially Biblical) Greek readers


## Background

*MorphGNT* and my *Morphological Lexicon* aren't quite rich enough yet to
produce the kind of readers I've long wanted to (much less the larger vision of
a *New Kind of Graded Reader*) but I've been inspired by Brian Renshaw's
(presumably manually produced) Greek Readers (e.g. [A Good Friday Greek Reader](http://ntexegesis.com/blog/2014/4/18/a-good-friday-greek-reader-john-18-19))
to at least put together a tool to show what's possible now and then build on
it.

Of course, this isn't the first time I've written code to generate documents
from my Greek New Testament databases. This year marks the 20th anniversary of
my *Index to the Greek New Testament* which was the first major project I
undertook based on MorphGNT.

What I'm initially putting together here is a Python 3 library and command-line
script driven by text files. Eventually, I'll make a website out of this so the
majority of the target audience can actually use it :-)

For other Greek projects of mine, see <http://jktauber.com/>.
